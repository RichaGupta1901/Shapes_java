# Shapes_java

This Java program allows users to calculate the area, perimeter, and volume of various 2D and 3D shapes. Users can select from a menu of shapes, input the required dimensions, and obtain the desired calculations.

## Supported Shapes
1. Circle
2. Sphere
3. Square
4. Rectangle
5. Cylinder
6. Pyramid

## File Structure
* **Main.java**: Contains the main method and the user interface for selecting shapes and performing calculations.
* **Shape.java**: An abstract class defining methods for calculating **area** and **perimeter**.
* **Volume.java**: An interface defining a method for calculating **volume**.
* **Circle.java, Sphere.java, Square.java, Rectangle.java, Cylinder.java, Pyramid.java**: Concrete classes implementing specific shapes and their calculations.

## Working of the Program
